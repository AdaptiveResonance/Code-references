myString = "5" #strings numbers are seen as character rather than a number
myFloat = 3.14159265358979 #floats can support decimals!
# All integers are long in python
# So we can convert myString to long integer
myLong = int(myString)
# Now myLong is both an integers and a long
print(myString)
print(myFloat)
print(myLong)

# 5
